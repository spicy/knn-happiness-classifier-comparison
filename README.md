# KNN Happiness Classifier Comparison

This project compares different K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers to predict happiness based on city and community factors.

## Features

- Custom KNN with Euclidean and Manhattan distances
- Comparison with scikit-learn's KNN
- Data visualization and model evaluation
- Cross-validation

## Key Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and prepare 'HappinessData-1.csv'.
2. **Custom KNN**: Implement KNN with Euclidean and Manhattan distances.
3. **Visualization**: Plot elbow curves for optimal K selection.
4. **Evaluation**: Compare custom KNN with scikit-learn KNN using metrics and execution time.
5. **Cross-Validation**: Perform 10-fold cross-validation.

## Dependencies

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook `knn-classifier-comparison.ipynb`.
